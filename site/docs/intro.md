# Intro

Today, we're going to break your old testing habits and learn some new ones.

This workshop consists of several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of improving your testing practices.

1. [Bad patterns](./category/bad-habits/) - We'll start by exploring some common but outdated testing patterns, and ways to improve them.
1. [Old patterns](./category/old-habits/) - We'll start by exploring some common but outdated testing patterns, and ways to improve them.
1. [JUnit 6](./category/junit-jupiter/) - Next, we'll upgrade to JUnit 6 and learn its new features.
1. [AssertJ](./category/adopt-assertj/) - Then, we'll dive into AssertJ for more expressive assertions.
