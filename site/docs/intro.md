# Intro

Today, we're going to break your old testing habits and learn some new ones.

This workshop consists of several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of improving your testing practices.

1. [Bad habits](./category/bad-habits/) - We'll start by exploring some common but outdated testing patterns, and ways to improve them.
1. [Old habits](./category/old-habits/) - After that, we'll look at legacy testing frameworks and libraries that are still in use today.
1. [JUnit Jupiter](./category/junit-jupiter/) - Next, we'll upgrade to JUnit 6 and learn its new features.
1. [Adopt AssertJ](./category/adopt-assertj/) - Then, we'll dive into AssertJ for more expressive assertions.
1. [Advanced AssertJ](./category/advanced-assertj/) - Finally, we'll master fluent assertions for cleaner and more maintainable tests.


## Getting Started

We recommend going through the sections in order, but you're welcome to go at your own pace.
There is a lot of material to cover, so feel free to take breaks and revisit sections as needed.

There are sources included with this repository that support your exploration of the topics,
but you're just as welcome to use your own projects to try out the improvements.
