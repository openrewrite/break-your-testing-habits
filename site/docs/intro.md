# Tutorial Intro

Today, we're going to break your old testing habits and learn some new ones.

This workshop consists of four tutorials:

1. [Old Patterns](bad-habits/intro) - We'll start by exploring some common but outdated testing patterns, and ways to improve them.
2. [JUnit 6](junit/intro) - Next, we'll upgrade to JUnit 6 and learn its new features.
3. [AssertJ](assertj/intro) - Then, we'll dive into AssertJ for more expressive assertions.
4. [Advanced Assertions](assertj-advanced/intro) - Finally, we'll master fluent assertions for cleaner and more maintainable tests.
