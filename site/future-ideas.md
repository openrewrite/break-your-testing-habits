- Show reference implementation of custom assertions.
- Created exercise for custom assertions on Order domain.
- Generate assertions https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/assertj-assertions-generator.html.
- There are many type specific assertions that can be used, that make the assertions a lot easier to read.
- ValueSource and ParameterizedTests
